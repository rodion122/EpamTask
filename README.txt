1) Enter the points (x,y) of the shape in the file (exception for circle: x y R - radius).
// Example (rectangle (x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 x4 y4) ):
1 1 4 1 4 4 1 4
// circle (x y R - radius) :
1 1 1
2) Each row is one shape. 
3) The area is calculated for shapes whose sides do not intersect (except for points from the file).
